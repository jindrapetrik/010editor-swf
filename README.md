# SWF Binary template for 010 Editor
This repository contains SWF binary template for 010 Editor.
SWF is binary format for Adobe Flash.

Me - JPEXS - imported the history files that were available on 010 Editor webpages (since v1.3)
so I can improve it later.

## Authors
Original author of the template is Josh Zelonis.
JPEXS continues to improve it since v1.4.
